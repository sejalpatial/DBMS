Experiment 1

--Title: Design and Implementation of a Library Management System using SQL

Experiment Description:
To design and implement a Library Management System database using appropriate tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, and to perform DML operations along with DCL commands such as role creation, privilege granting, and revoking to ensure database security.

---Objective
To design and implement a Library Management System database using appropriate tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, and to perform DML operations along with DCL commands such as role creation, privilege granting, and revoking to ensure database security.

---Practical / Experiment Steps:
Create tables for Books, Members, and Book Issue Records
Define primary key and foreign key constraints
Insert sample data into the tables
Perform update and delete operations
Create a database role named Librarian
Grant and revoke permissions using role-based access control
Verify the correctness of operations using SELECT queries

---Procedure of the Experiment:
Start the system and log in to the computer.
Open the PostgreSQL environment using pgAdmin.
Create or select the required database.
Write SQL commands to create tables with appropriate constraints.
Insert records into the tables using INSERT statements.
Execute UPDATE and DELETE commands to modify records.
Create a role named Librarian with login credentials.
Grant SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE permissions to the role.
Revoke the permissions to verify role-based access control.
Execute SELECT queries to verify data integrity and results.

---Input / Output Analysis:
Input Provided:
SQL commands for table creation
Sample records inserted into Book, Members, and Book_Issue tables
UPDATE and DELETE queries
Role creation and permission commands

Output Generated:
Successfully created tables with constraints
Records inserted and displayed correctly
Member details updated successfully
Records deleted with referential integrity maintained
Role created and permissions granted/revoked successfully

---Learning Outcome:
How to design a relational database schema
Practical use of primary keys and foreign keys
Importance of data integrity and constraints
Implementation of role-based database security
