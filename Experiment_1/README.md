Experiment 1

--Title: Design and Implementation of a Library Management System using SQL

Experiment Description:
This experiment focuses on designing and implementing a Library Management System database to manage books, members, and book issue records efficiently using SQL commands. The experiment also demonstrates role-based access control to ensure database security.

---Objective

The objectives of this practical session are:
To design relational database tables using appropriate primary keys and foreign keys
To implement INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
To understand referential integrity constraints
To create and manage database roles and permissions
To gain hands-on experience with SQL commands in a DBMS environment

---Practical / Experiment Steps
Create tables for Books, Members, and Book Issue Records
Define primary key and foreign key constraints
Insert sample data into the tables
Perform update and delete operations
Create a database role named Librarian
Grant and revoke permissions using role-based access control
Verify the correctness of operations using SELECT queries

---Procedure of the Experiment
Start the system and log in to the computer.
Open the PostgreSQL environment using pgAdmin.
Create or select the required database.
Write SQL commands to create tables with appropriate constraints.
Insert records into the tables using INSERT statements.
Execute UPDATE and DELETE commands to modify records.
Create a role named Librarian with login credentials.
Grant SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE permissions to the role.
Revoke the permissions to verify role-based access control.
Execute SELECT queries to verify data integrity and results.

---Input / Output Analysis
Input Provided:
SQL commands for table creation
Sample records inserted into Book, Members, and Book_Issue tables
UPDATE and DELETE queries
Role creation and permission commands

Output Generated:
Successfully created tables with constraints
Records inserted and displayed correctly
Member details updated successfully
Records deleted with referential integrity maintained
Role created and permissions granted/revoked successfully

---Learning Outcome
How to design a relational database schema
Practical use of primary keys and foreign keys
Importance of data integrity and constraints
Implementation of role-based database security
