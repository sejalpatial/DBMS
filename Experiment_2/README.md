Experiment 2

AIM--To understand and implement SQL SELECT queries using various clauses such as WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently from relational database tables.

OBJECTIVE--
●	To practice writing SQL SELECT statements.

●	To apply filtering conditions using the WHERE clause.

●	To sort query results using the ORDER BY clause.

●	To group records using the GROUP BY clause.

●	To filter grouped data using the HAVING clause.

●	To analyze data using aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().

Practical / Experiment Steps
•	Create an EMPLOYEE table with appropriate attributes
•	Insert sample employee records into the table
•	Filter employees based on salary condition
•	Calculate department-wise average salary
•	Display only departments meeting the given criteria
•	Sort the final output in descending order of average salary

Procedure of the Experiment

1.	Start the system and log in to the computer.
2.	Open PostgreSQL / pgAdmin.
3.	Create or select the required database.
4.	Create the EMPLOYEE table using SQL CREATE TABLE command.
5.	Insert sample employee records using INSERT statements.
6.	Execute the SQL query using:
o	WHERE clause
o	GROUP BY clause
o	HAVING clause
o	ORDER BY clause
7.	Verify the output generated by the query.
8.	Save the work and take screenshots of the execution results.

Input / Output Analysis
Input Provided:
•	Employee details including:
o	Employee ID
o	Employee Name
o	Department
o	Salary
o	Joining Date
•	SQL query applying filtering, grouping, and sorting conditions
Output Generated:
•	Department names with their average salary
•	Only departments where:
o	Employee salary > 20,000
o	Average department salary > 30,000
•	Output arranged in descending order of average salary
📸 Screenshots of table creation, data insertion, and query output are attached.

Learning Outcome

●	Filter records using the WHERE clause.

●	Group records using GROUP BY.

●	Apply conditions on grouped data using HAVING.

●	Sort query results using ORDER BY.
